\chapter{High Energy Physics}

The idea of atoms - building blocks of nature stretch back as far as ancient greece, to Leucippus and Democritus \cite{10.3138/9781442671102}, and prevailed through the ages, until the beginning of the 20th century, when it was solidified. In 1897 J.J.Thompson discovered electron using cathode ray and noticing it's negative charge \cite{thomson1901bodies}.  Later in 1911 Rutherford discovered the nucleus using the gold foil scattering experiment \cite{doi:10.1080/14786440508637080}. Shortly after that in 1932 the model of the nucleus containing neutron and proton was developed \cite{Iwanenko1932TheNH} \cite{1932ZPhy...77....1H}. This opened the
